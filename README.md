# Flood-Detection-GIS
The major goal of this research is to map changes in a
region before and after a flood. This project will attempt
to depict how the landscapes of the region change
following a flood. This will help to gain a better sense of
where floods inflict the greatest damage, and then
preventative actions may be made to preserve civilian lives
and infrastructure after evaluating the worst-affected
places on the map if floods are expected in the coming
years. For this project, we'll look at three different places
(Maharashtra, Kerala, and South Carolina) and map the
changes in these areas before and after floods.
